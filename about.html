                      <p>I'm a design generalist who strives to craft simple solutions to complex problems. I’m on the hunt for my next adventure and am <span style="font-weight: 700; background-color: var(--peachy); padding: 0 5px;">currently looking to join a great team</span> who’s eager to ship great product and share knowledge.</p>
                      <p>I began my career at a design agency where I encountered a wide array of problems and developed a strong foundation in information architecture. I had the opportunity to work with a variety of clients, ranging from top names like AOL, Royal Caribbean, and Gensler to local D.C. heroes like Clutch.</p>
                      <p>After nearly 3 years of agency life, I had a strong desire to live with a single product, breathe in its problems as my own, and iterate, iterate, iterate. So I dove into the deep end as a product designer at a fintech startup. Working as a sole designer embedded in the engineering team, I strengthened my skills in visual design, front-end coding, and user research (among others). </p> 
                      <p>In my free time, you can find me playing tennis, learning something new, or walking/biking my beautiful neighborhood of Del Ray, Alexandria.</p>
