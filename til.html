                    <p>Learned the crazy story of how Playtex won the contract to produce NASA's spacesuits. They got swindled out of the competition by defense contractors but they flew to Houston and begged to compete. In just 6 weeks, they had to design and build a suit that could withstand temperatures as low as negative 280&#176;F and as high as 240&#176;F all while housing a flexible astronaut and theirpressurized atmosphere.</p>
                    <p>When their prototype went head-to-head in user testing, it was the clear winner. One rival suit had a helmet blow off and the other couldn't fit through the hatch! Expert seamstresses working on bras and underwear suddenly had the more daunting job of sewing a 21-layer spacesuit. They couldn't be more than 1/32 inch off and had to count every single stitch to ensure quality.</p>
                    <p>Their hard work paid off – the same group (now ILC Dover) makes every NASA spacesuit to this day. And they're based right nearby in Delaware. Pretty cool!

                    <p>I just finished a book called <a href="https://brandonsanderson.com/books/mistborn/the-final-empire/" target="_blank" class="inline-link"><em>Mistborn</em> by Brandon Sanderson</a> – it was incredible! I haven't voraciously crushed through a book like that in a long time. When my friend recommended it, I have to admit I was a little skeptical given that it's a long fantasy novel. But it had everything you could want in a book. I learned that Sanderson's goal was to bring the level of intrigue of a heist movie like <em>Ocean's Eleven</em> to an epic sci-fi setting. It's no wonder I was instantly captured (we love Steven Soderbergh movies in this household).</p>
                    <p>Combine that with a really interesting system of magic, lovable characters, and Sanderson's accessible writing style, you've got a winner of a book. Oh, and it's just book one of a trilogy! I'll be cracking into the second of the series ASAP.</p>

                    <p>Today I learned the French phrase "Ça me donne le cafard." If you translate this literally, it means "That gives me the cockroach" – gross! However, the French love their expressions and the understood meaning of the phrase is "That depresses me."</p>
                    <p>Though cockroach is the most common translation of <em>le cafard</em>, it can also mean hypocrite (likely taken from the Arabic <em>kafr</em> meaning miscreant or non-believer). Turns out the poet Charles Baudelaire invented the depressing translation in <em>Les Fleurs du mal</em> in 1857.

                    <p>Today I learned some great advantages of Jekyll. My code for this portfolio site had become <em>so repetitive</em> with a head, nav, and footer on every page template. Needless to say, changing something in any of those areas was a huge pain. I met up with a former coworker asking him how I could approach using Rails partials or something similar to clean it up. We talked through a few different strategies like Rails, Vue, etc. but all of them sounded overly complex for what I needed.</p>
                    <p>I really wanted to launch this site on Github Pages, so we started poking around with Jekyll and voilà! Jekyll has its own <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/includes/" target="_blank" class="inline-link"><em>includes</em></a> feature which allows you to call content from another file. My code is so much cleaner! Thank God I had help though – the Jekyll documentation is minimal and they didn't explicitly state that you have to override their default layout and then declare the type of layout at the top of each page. Tricky stuff. A huge shoutout and thank you to Nisarg for figuring that out!</p>

                    <p>I'm back! Since I moved from D.C. out to Alexandria, I've been fascinated by the birds around the neighborhood. Over the summer, you can see a flock of <a href="https://www.audubon.org/field-guide/bird/chimney-swift#" target="_blank" class="inline-link">chimney swifts</a> that circle the chimney of an adjacent apartment building every evening as they forage. These special swifts can't perch on a tree branch like other birds. Their claws are made only for clinging to bark or brick (which is why the inside of a chimney is a perfect place for them to live).</p>
                    <p>They can eat up to 1/3 of their body weight in insects each day. Oh, and their saliva acts as a glue that holds their nest to a brick wall – how cool! </p>

                    <p>Today I dug into some of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loretta_Lynn" target="_blank">Loretta Lynn's</a> songs. What an incredible musician. She married very young – 15, and had 4 kids by the time she was 20 years old. And yet she went on to become the most awarded female artist in country music. Some of her songs were controversial – "The Pill", for example. Loretta recorded it in 1972 but the record held it from release until 1975. Some radio stations banned it but the catchy tune still managed to become her highest-charting <em>pop</em> single and spread the word of birth control to overburdened women around America. <a href="https://youtu.be/ROA4ha9f09w?t=200" target="_blank">Thanks, Loretta!</a></p>
