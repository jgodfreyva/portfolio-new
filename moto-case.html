                <h6>For a fintech company inviting customers to refinance their auto loan online, the original marketing site was an alarming starting point. We needed to overhaul the site as quickly as possible to reflect the company's modern, user-friendly, and trustworthy product.</h6>

            <h2>Project Background</h2>
            <p>In fall 2017, I joined MotoRefi as the first permanent designer. I saw the opportunity to work with a wonderful team of highly-skilled developers, dig into a complex product flow, and overhaul an outdated marketing site. By the time we tackled the redesign in mid-2018, we had consistently heard from our customer support team that many calls they received were inquiries as to whether we were a legitimate company.</p> 
            <p>The marketing site not only <em>looked</em> bad; it served as an ominous welcome mat for potential customers searching online for a safe, simple way to refinance their car loan. And even though our developers ensured that the product met the latest security standards, users saw the marketing site first, losing any sense of trust for MotoRefi that they might have gained.</p>
            <hr class="caption-rule">
            <h6 class="media-caption-dark-bg">The original site looked archaic and ill-fitting for a fintech company. Trust is crucial in a high-stakes transaction like refinance and this site caused customers to doubt our legitimacy.</h6>

              <h2>Diving into the Redesign</h2>
              <p>We needed to turn the marketing site around… <em>fast</em>. With the new project as my primary focus, I established a rough timeline and immediately turned my attention to wireframing the major pages of the new site – the Homepage, How It Works, FAQs, About Us, and Contact. I worked with the Head of Marketing and VP of Engineering to fill in any missing pieces.</p>
              <p>With information architecture agreed upon, I presented potential design directions and emphasized that our design and brand needed to strike a balance of friendliness and institutional expertise. If we leaned too far into friendly designs, we ran the risk of not matching users’ expectations of what financial services should look like and instead, sowing the seeds of distrust. I used this theory to expand and establish our design language for the new site. I would normally advocate to pause here to user test our concepts, however time was of the essence and <em>any</em> thoughtful updates would be an improvement to the site we had.</p>
