            <h2>Project Background</h2>
            <p>In fall 2017, I joined MotoRefi as the first permanent designer. I saw the opportunity to work with a wonderful team of highly-skilled developers, dig into a complex product flow, and overhaul an outdated marketing site. By the time we tackled the redesign in mid-2018, we had consistently heard from our customer support team that many calls they received were inquiries as to whether we were a legitimate company.</p> 
            <p>The marketing site not only <em>looked</em> bad; it served as an ominous welcome mat for potential customers searching online for a safe, simple way to refinance their car loan. And even though our developers ensured that the product met the latest security standards, users saw the marketing site first, losing any sense of trust for MotoRefi that they might have gained.</p>

            <h6 class="media-caption-dark-bg">The original site looked archaic and ill-fitting for a fintech company. Trust is crucial in a high-stakes transaction like refinance and this site caused customers to question our legitimacy.</h6>

              <h2>Diving into the Redesign</h2>
              <p>We needed to turn the marketing site around… <em>fast</em>. With the new project as my primary focus, I established a rough timeline and immediately turned my attention to aligning our goals and wireframing the major pages of the new site – the Homepage, How It Works, FAQs, About Us, and Contact. I worked with the Head of Marketing and VP of Engineering to fill in any missing pieces.</p>
              <p>With information architecture agreed upon, I presented potential design directions and emphasized that our design and brand needed to strike a balance of friendliness and institutional expertise. If we leaned too far into friendly designs, we ran the risk of not matching users’ expectations of what financial services should look like and instead, sowing the seeds of distrust. I used this theory to expand and establish our design language for the new site. I would normally advocate to pause here to user test our concepts, however time was of the essence and <em>any</em> thoughtful updates would be an improvement to the site we had.</p>

              <h2>Visuals: From Illustration to Animation</h2>
              <p>The original company brand guide was limited. For instance, our colors included the logo’s blue and green, a few supporting shades of dark blue and gray, and a shock of orange that we only used to demarcate issues in the product flow. I knew we would need to incorporate illustration into the marketing site as too many stock photos of people and cars would appear phony and dull. So, I set to work firming up our set of primary blues, secondary shades of gray (warming them up slightly to better convey approachability), and introduced a new set of accent colors – gold and peach – to help bring our illustrations to life.</p>
              <p>I also set out to find a new headline font to complement our system-wide Roboto workhorse. Barlow Semi Condensed has a cheerful affect but can still be taken seriously. I chose the semi-condensed version knowing that some of our headlines and content could get quite lengthy.</p>
              <p>From there I was off to the races. Working as a solo designer, it was an intimidating task to tackle all of the visuals but I was excited for the challenge.</p>
              <div class="img-container-light-bg"><img src="img/BrandElements.jpg"></div>
              <h6 class="media-caption-light-bg">
                In expanding our design language, I aimed to build on our blue/green palette, making it more versatile and supportive of friendly illustrations.

              <div class="section-break"></div>
              <p>To gain trust points with prospective customers, we incorporated our Better Business Bureau (BBB) badge/rating as well as customer testimonials. Perhaps most importantly, we included the logos of our partners who already had brand traction with our audience (e.g. Equifax, TransUnion, CarFax). Interestingly in the <a href="moto-case.html#posttesting">post-launch user testing</a>, participants mentioned that the partner logos should be higher up on the page. I took that feedback and replaced a customer testimonial right below the hero image with the familiar logos, helping to further legitimize our web presence.</p>

              <p>One of the areas I strongly pushed for was to include headshots of a few of our support team members next to the company’s contact information. This was not because we have some of the best smiles in the business (I’m biased!). Our customers raved about our support team and in the financial industry, picking up the phone and speaking with a human being who can help is unfortunately rare. It’s one of MotoRefi’s competitive edges and a strong reason to showcase our team. In our <a href="moto-case.html#posttesting">post-launch user testing</a>, participants often commented on the headshots as a positive feature and one that helped them trust us more.</p>
              <div class="img-container-light-bg"><img src="img/support-headshots.png"></div>
              <h6 class="media-caption-light-bg">
                I persuaded leadership to incorporate headshots of our support team on the Homepage. Later user testing proved that my assumption was correct: the photos reassured users that they could easily call us and speak with a helpful human rather than a bank bot.

              <h2>Adventures in Code</h2>
              <p>As I finalized designs for the new site, one of our lead developers worked to build components in our first pattern library. Once those were edited and finalized, the engineers started to bring the site to life. At each stopping point, I paired with the developer to tweak CSS where needed and fill in responsive gaps on the Bootstrap grid.</p> 
              <p>One of the areas where designer/developer pairing was especially rewarding was solving the ever-present problem of team headshots on the <em>About Us</em> page. In any company, turnover is inevitable. My design to showcase the team featured alternating background colors (green/blue/green/blue) on each headshot to liven it up.</p>
              <p>This would’ve caused a serious headache when adding or removing any team member as it would show repetition in the pattern (green/green/blue). Working with a developer, we used the power of JavaScript to program in the alternating background color and I re-edited the headshots with a transparent background. Voilà! Any time someone joined or left the team, the background colors would update automatically.</p>
              <p>Even better: I learned how to navigate and edit the Ruby on Rails views and partials so that developers didn’t need to waste precious time updating the page. I added and removed team members on my own and pushed the code for review before another developer merged it in.</p>
              <div class="img-container-light-bg">

                An engineer and I paired up to program in these alternating background colors (and prevent future headaches). I took the reins from there, pushing my own code each time we added/removed team members.

              <h2>Ship It!</h2>
              <p>In early August 2018, we pushed the new site live! To get the rest of the company involved (and help us check our work), I led a QC event where all of our coworkers went through the site on their computers and phones to look for bugs, typos, etc. The two people who discovered the most errors won a gift card. It was a simple way to crowdsource QA/QC assistance as myself and the dev team had been staring at the site for far too long.</p>
              <p>In September 2018, I recorded some pre/post launch stats from Google Analytics, showing that the redesign was indicating signs of success.</p>

              <h2>Post-Launch: Putting It to the Test</h2>
              <p>Although these stats were showing good results, we wanted to test some of our assumptions that had guided us from the beginning – specifically the friendly yet professional design language. We hired a contract designer who delivered 2 alternate design styles for the Homepage.</p>
              <p>I recruited participants for our study via Craigslist (yes, Craigslist!) and we used a short screening survey to target users in our general age, income, and FICO score demographics. Then 2 coworkers from the marketing team and myself lined up 30+ phone interviews and completed 28 total.</p>
              <p>On each interview, we showed the participant in random order the current Homepage design as well as the 2 alternate versions, asking them to generally discuss their impressions of the design and how it made them feel. At the end, we showed them all 3 of the designs and asked them 2 major questions:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>“Now that you’ve seen all 3 designs, which would you say is your favorite?”</li>
                  <li>“If you were to input sensitive personal information like your social security number and income, which the 3 designs would put you most at ease?”</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The results from these key questions spoke for themselves:</p>
              <div class=" left-stat stat-highlight col-md-6">
                    <h1>75<span class="stat-percent">%</span></h1>
                    <h6>of participants said the current Homepage was their favorite</h6>
              </div>
              <div class="right-stat stat-highlight col-md-6">
                    <h1>67<span class="stat-percent">%</span></h1>
                    <h6>of participants picked my design as the one that put them most at ease</h6>
              </div>
              <p>In addition, we heard comments that validated our original design approach, stating that the site appeared “professional and personal” and “like a traditional website that has been reinvented”. A few participants mentioned that the illustrations add a fun spin and makes dealing with a financial service less daunting.</p>
              <p>Although I don’t recommend completing a large redesign without testing assumptions along the way, my instincts in this case were close enough that we made the correct call in favoring speed to launch over extending the timeline to include early testing.</p>
              <p>Our post-launch study also provided some valuable feedback that we acted upon in a round of edits. This included better highlighting of the partner logos and our “no impact to your credit” statement. A takeaway that I found especially interesting – most users reacted positively to the support team headshots next to our contact information, saying “It’s reassuring that you’ll be helped by a person, not a bot.” However, we learned of a small subset of people who thought they were <em>actors</em> or stock photos, not real employees. I added in each representative’s name with their photo in attempts to dispel this skepticism, with plans to address it further in future edits.</p>

            <h2>TL;DR Project Takeaways</h2>
            <p>As a solo designer, I was incredibly proud to have designed MotoRefi’s new marketing site from top to bottom. I jumped into it with some strong opinions and assumptions on how the site should look in order to launch the site (and replace the archaic old version) as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p>In the end, our team’s hard work paid off. Early results showed that the bounce rate of 66.79% <strong>decreased to 48.59%</strong> and average session duration <strong>increased by 40+ seconds</strong>. Our post-launch user test validated my gut instincts when it came to the design direction, with a strong majority of participants choosing my design over 2 alternate versions.</p>
